# Autocompletion
Autocompletion is powered by [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) with coc-tsserver for Javascript and Typescript.

# Syntax
My config uses [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot) for syntax highlighting.

# NERDTree
I use [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree). It is absolutely awesome, and makes navigating through tons of file so much easier.
